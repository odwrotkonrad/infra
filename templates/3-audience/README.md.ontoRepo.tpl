# infra

The `restricted` group and the sandbox identity it holds, as Terraform.

{{ renderMarkdown "assets/docs-agents/purpose.md" "normalize-headings" }}

## Two concerns, one state

- **Group tree** — `tf/terraform.tfvars` + `tf/levels.tf` + `tf/modules/level`, the
  same `level` pattern as `infra/git-repos`, trimmed (no GitHub mirror, no local
  runner). The `restricted` root group is UI-created and imported (`parent_id =
  null`); Terraform owns its `infra` project and branch protection.
- **Identity/secrets** — `tf/gitlab-token.tf`, `tf/ssh-key.tf`,
  `tf/gcp-identity.tf`, `tf/secrets.tf`: the `konradodwrot` group token, the
  sandbox SSH key, the restricted GCP SA, and the two Secrets Manager secrets the
  sandbox reads.

Both share one state in the separate `konradodwrot-restricted-tfstate` GCS
bucket, isolated from git-repos at the storage boundary.

## State bucket bootstrap (one-time)

The state bucket must exist before `make init` — a bucket cannot hold the state
that creates it. Create it out-of-band, applied by your own identity:

```sh
gcloud storage buckets create gs://konradodwrot-restricted-tfstate \
  --project=main-493613 --location=EU --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

Lock its IAM to your identity (and the restricted CI identity if CI applies).

## First apply

```sh
make init                 # binds to konradodwrot-restricted-tfstate
# import the UI-created group and (if pre-created) the infra project:
terraform -chdir=tf import 'module.l0.gitlab_group.this["restricted"]' 203029
make validate && make plan && make apply
```

## Restricted SA key into 1Password (one-time, after apply)

Terraform does not write to op. Push the SA key JSON into op once:

```sh
terraform -chdir=tf output -raw restricted_sa_key \
  | op item edit sandbox_restricted sa_key=-
```

## CI variables (masked + protected)

`tf/ci-variables.tf` creates two masked, protected group variables on the
`restricted` group for the CI applier: `TF_GITLAB_TOKEN` (the restricted CI's
own gitlab token, not the sandbox token) and `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` (base64 SA
key). Values come from sensitive inputs and enter the (storage-isolated)
restricted state. Populate them one of two ways:

- **TF-managed:** pass at apply — `TF_VAR_ci_gitlab_token=… TF_VAR_ci_google_credentials=… make apply`.
- **Manual:** leave the vars empty; Terraform creates the group variables empty, then set their values in the GitLab UI (still masked + protected).

Job logs are private on every restricted project (`public_jobs = false`), so
neither variable is ever exposed to a non-member.

## Token isolation

The `konradodwrot` group token has zero reach into `restricted` (separate root
group). Prove it: `GITLAB_TOKEN=<token> glab api groups/restricted` returns
403/404.
